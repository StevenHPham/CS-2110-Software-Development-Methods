# CS-2110-Software-Development-Methods

## Course Description

If you take a moment to think about all the ways computerization has penetrated our daily lives, from having the weather forecast at your fingertips to life and death decision making, the importance of writing precise and correct computer instruction (code) is self-evident.

## Who Should Take This Course?

This is a second course in computing and software development, with an emphasis both on software development concepts and on principles central to computer science. To achieve this, the course has a number of objectives:

(a) understand and implement object-oriented programming principles;

(b) be introduced to the way software systems are designed, implemented, tested, and
maintained;

(c) apply best practices in terms of system testing to save time, minimize cost, and avoid
hardships;

(d) expand on existing experience with the art of computer science;

(e) provide practical experience in software engineering and to increase your skill as a
programmer.


## Prerequisites:


To be successful, students should:
● Have the equivalent of one semester of programming knowledge (specific language does
not matter), as demonstrated by any of the following:
● Have taken CS 1110/1111/1112/1120 with a C- or better.
● Have credit on your transcript for an equivalent course from high school or another
university.
● Passed the CS 1110 placement exam, AP exam, IB exam, etc.
(​http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sherriff/cs1110/placement.php​ Go to this link for information on the placement test. It must be turned in by 3:30pm the first Friday of the term to be used as a prerequisite for this course).
If you feel you have ​not ​met these prerequisites, please contact the instructor ​immediately​. Evaluating Your Progress in the Course
Participation (15%)​: Studies show the more you engage the more you will learn. In order to achieve this, everyone should be participating in activities, peer collaborations, and discussions both in and out of class. Further, speaking with peers will result in different points of views and ideas to come to the surface. Participation will chiefly be measured in the form of peer collaborations through various in-class activities. For most in-class activities you will be expected to turn your work in individually. ​Three (3) in-class activities may be missed without penalty. This is intended to cover health issues, school conflicts, school-related travel, and other circumstances.
For most classes there is an assigned reading (see ​Course Schedule on Collab Home page). We expect you to have completed this reading ​before class. We will conduct lecture under the assumption that you have completed this reading. This is intended to get you familiar with the topics but we don’t expect you to have mastered the material at this time. Some lecture topics will not be part of any of the course texts.
Labs (10%)​: Activities in lab provide supplementary hands-on experience with concepts, skills, and problem solving relating to topics from the current material, including material not covered in lecture. Given the group setting, labs are a perfect way to learn from your peers and discuss the material. You also have the opportunity to discuss your lab work with the TAs present who can provide additional feedback and support. Unlike homework assignments, lab activities allow you to practice skills in a group setting and in some cases explore certain topics deeper.
     2

 Weekly labs are held in Rice 130 and are run by graduate and undergraduate TAs. You must bring ​your own laptop to labs. Each lab section will have a dedicated Head TA and supporting TAs. (Head TA information is available on the Home page of the CS 2110 Collab page.) Some topics that are covered in lab are not discussed during lecture. You are responsible for all material provided in lab even if you are absent. It is therefore imperative you attend lab regularly, and you must also attend your assigned lab section. Attendance in lab is mandatory and will be taken directly. Arriving late, leaving early, or not participating while present may result in a reduction of lab grade.
One (1) lab may be missed without penalty. This is intended to cover health issues, school conflicts, school-related travel, and other circumstances. If you know that you will miss a lab but could meet at another lab time, you may contact the head TAs of both labs to see if attending the other lab is acceptable. Abuse of this policy will result in your request being denied and possibly a lowering of your lab grade.
Homework Assignments (25%)​: Homework assignments help you practice coding, apply concepts and skills, and develop your computer science and software development skills. There will be around eight homework assignments. The assignments will be a combination of programming problems and paper-and-pencil activities that address the topics studied. These assignments provide you hands-on experience with course material. All coding assignments are individual assignments​. Coding questions do show up on exams and possibly in other contexts, so the more practice you have the stronger your problem solving and programming skills will be!
Homework assignments will not be handed out in class; they will be made available online, and will be submitted online. Each assignment will describe its grading criteria. Resources available to you for completing homework assignments are: Piazza, instructors (asking in class or during office hours), TAs, textbooks, and official Java APIs (Oracle website). Homework assignments are due by ​11:30 PM on the day they are due, and may be submitted up to 48 hours late, with 10% off if submitted by the submission time the day after it was due and 20% off if submitted two days after it was due. Homework will not be accepted 48 hours after the deadline. Homework submission details will be provided within each assignment. ​No homework assignments will be dropped.
Quizzes (10%)​: There will be a number of quizzes given throughout the course, typically one each week, to ensure you are understanding the main ideas of the topic at hand. All quizzes are accessed through the Quizzes tab on Collab. Quizzes will typically be short and will mainly be multiple choice questions. Quizzes will be posted on Friday at 5:00 PM and be due the following
    3

  Sunday by ​11:30 PM unless otherwise noted (it’s the student’s responsibility to keep up with this each week). ​The equivalent of one quiz​ will be excused.
Exams (Exam 1, 2, Final Exam) ​(10% for each midterm, 20% for the final)​: There will be three exams. These exams are designed to assess the content knowledge, skills and concepts you learn during the semesters. Exam 1 will cover the first third of the course, Exam 2 will cover the second third of the course, and the Final Exam will mainly cover the remainder of the course, with some material from the first two-thirds. Each exam will consist of a mix of questions, and may include: multiple-choice, coding, short-answer, compare-contrast, applied concept, and true-false questions.
Let the instructor know as soon as possible ​before the exam if you are aware of a conflict with any of these exams. Any non-excused absence will result in a zero (0) on the corresponding exam.
. Updated information on all exam dates and locations will be available on the CS 2110 Collab page.
Your final letter grade for the semester will be determined according to the following scale:
Grade Minimum Maximum
 ​The ​final exam is currently scheduled for ALL sections at ​7:00 PM on Monday,

Course Resources
A textbook is a great resource that supplements the classroom experience. The ​two primary textbooks for the course are listed below, along with other suggested resources:
1. [Primary] ​BIG JAVA Early Objects, Sixth Edition​ by Cay Horstmann
2. [Primary] ​Modern Software Development Using Java, Second Edition​ by Paul Tymann
and G. Michael Schneider. This text is freely available online at http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ptt/msd/​. Affordable print copies are hard to find. ​Don’t use the First edition​.
3. You should own or have access to a good ​Java reference book​. If you don’t you might try an online source such as:
   ○ ○ ○ ○
​Java Programming​ (a wikibook)
​Thinking in Java​ by Bruce Eckel;
Introduction to Computer Science using Java​ by Bradley Kjell; or Fred Swartz’s​ ​topic-based review​.
    4. CodingBat ​(​http://codingbat.com/java​) ​is a free online website to help you build coding skill in Java (Python, too!) Going through many practice problems is a great way to practice and solidify your understanding of coding concepts. We will assign specific problems from this site early on in the semester.
If you find other good online references​, let us know!
Other readings may be assigned from the Web or provided by the instructors.
Course Schedule
The course schedule will be posted on the CS 2110 Collab page.

Regrades
After assigned work (homework, exams, quizzes, labs, etc.) is returned, it may be that you would like to discuss the points you earned for one or more questions. This is called a regrade request. Unless indicated otherwise, all regrade requests must be made within ​7 days of the assignment being returned to the student.
Please note the following:
● Regrade requests for exams will be made with the instructors during office hours or an
agreed upon scheduled time; homework and lab requests will be made directly to the TA
responsible for grading the assignment.
● Regrade requests are appropriate when an assignment has been graded incorrectly, and
should be specific.
● Graders may reduce points for invalid regrade requests such as attempts to negotiate
grades. Only submit a regrade if you feel there is a grading error.
● If your answer contains things that are not part of a correct answer, we take that into
account during grading. "I had the correct answer in there somewhere" is not a compelling regrade argument. Also, vague regrade requests such as, "​I think I need more points on this question​" are frivolous and may result in a deduction of points (up to 2% of the available score on the assignment)!

 Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity
Collaboration
Collaboration is a great way to learn, therefore you are encouraged to help one another out, but you must not cheat. When you cheat you only harm yourself. When you work hard and accomplish something it feels good. You gain a sense of self-confidence and you build self-esteem. When you cheat, you are admitting to yourself that you do not believe in your own abilities. The emphasis of this class is to give you the skills to help you learn and be better problem solvers. If you are struggling or need assistance, the instructors and the course staff are here to help you. Please reach out to us!
When collaborating with other students you may get help understanding course content​, but may not get help completing course assignments​. The following table gives a few examples of the kinds of questions that are OK to ask, and the kinds of questions that are not. It is ​not a comprehensive list; if you are unsure, ask an instructor!
This is OK... This is NOT OK...
Explain the idea behind this problem? How did you solve this problem?
Academic Integrity
The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University's Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future.
Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud (http://www.student.virginia.edu/~honor/proc/fraud.html). Sharing work without permission, turning in others' work as your own, or otherwise behaving in ways inconsistent with the community of trust is not permitted.
● Sending, receiving, posting, reading, viewing, comparing, or otherwise copying any part of course assignments or solutions is not allowed except when explicitly
    Could you explain this class example?
   Could you explain the solution to this homework assignment?
    8

 permitted in assignment instructions. This includes solutions from other students in
the course, past or present.
● All assignments, quizzes, exams, etc, are individual work. If additional collaboration is allowed on any given assignment, that assignment will describe the parameters by which collaboration is allowed. Deviations from these will be considered Honor violations​. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask!
○ Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help.
○ Sharing or describing exams, exam questions, quizzes, or quiz questions with or in the presence of any student who has not yet taken that exam is a violation of the honor code.
○ Working together or sharing information in any way during an exam is a violation of the honor code.
● Misrepresenting yourself or failing to cite sources of work not your own is a violation of the honor code.
Therefore, if you are assisted by any source of information other than the course textbook and the activities in lecture and lab, you ​must cite that information source specifically, with enough information for us to find and verify the content received. Failure to do so is ​plagiarism​. If you consulted a web tutorial, a different book, a TA, an instructor during office hours, a friend, or any other source, you must specifically acknowledge their help. ​Remember: follow the collaboration directions above, the source should not be a posted, shared, or otherwise obtained solution to the problem and may only guide you in understanding the topic.
● In source code, your citation must be done ​both in a comment at the ​top of the .java file listing the sources you consulted (with URLs, computing IDs, email addresses, etc) and comments by each piece in which you were assisted mentioning who or what assisted you and how.
Reminder: you may not view another student’s solution or provide your own; that includes “starting from” some other solution or “gaining insights” from another solution (either directly shared or posted online). ​ Doing so is a violation of this honor policy.
Penalties
Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Penalty​ ​– up to 100% course grade penalty
If course staff detect cheating, plagiarism, sharing or copying another solution to an assignment, or other dishonest behavior, they may impose any penalty up to and including a failing grade in the course​. This is independent of and in addition to the operations of the Honor Code.
  9

 If an infraction of the honor code is detected, it may result in a zero grade for the assignment, an F in the course, and may also be submitted to the Honor Committee as appropriate.
Participation/Professionalism Penalty​ ​– up to 10% course grade penalty
Unprofessional behavior such as: misbehavior towards instructor/classmates/TAs, and causing distractions for other students can be held against a student when final grades are calculated. Penalty can be up to 10% of course grade.
SDAC & Other Special Circumstances
If you have been identified as a ​Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) student, please let the Center know you are taking this class. If you suspect you should be an SDAC student, please schedule an appointment with them for an evaluation. I happily and discretely provide the recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC. Please contact your instructor at least one week before an exam so we can make accommodations.

sdac@virginia.edu
 If you are affected by a situation that falls within issues addressed by the SDAC and the instructor and staff are not informed about this in advance, this prevents us from helping during the semester, and it is unfair to request special considerations at the end of the term or after work is completed. So we request you inform the instructor as early in the term as possible your circumstances.
If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.) please contact your instructor and/or Head TA as soon as you know these may affect you in class.
Alternatively, there are also other University of Virginia resources available. The Student Health Center offers ​Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for its students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially over the phone, call Madison House's HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
